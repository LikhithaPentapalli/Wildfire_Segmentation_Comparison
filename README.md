# Wildfire_Segmentation_Comparison
A deep learning-based wildfire monitoring framework for semantic segmentation, wildfire region analysis, fire severity assessment, and comparative evaluation of multiple segmentation models using the FLAME dataset.

## 📌 Project Overview
Wildfires pose significant environmental and economic threats, making early detection and accurate monitoring essential. This project develops an intelligent wildfire monitoring framework that automatically identifies wildfire regions from aerial imagery using deep learning semantic segmentation.

The study compares three state-of-the-art segmentation models:
- U-Net
- Attention U-Net
- DeepLabV3+

The segmented wildfire regions are further analyzed to estimate the fire-affected area and classify wildfire severity into different risk levels.

Based on experimental evaluation, the best-performing model is selected for future development toward real-world wildfire monitoring applications.

## 🎯 Objectives

## 🧠 Deep Learning Models

### 1. U-Net
U-Net is a convolutional neural network specifically designed for image segmentation. It consists of an encoder-decoder architecture with skip connections that preserve spatial information, making it highly effective for pixel-level segmentation tasks.

**Advantages**
- Fast training
- Simple architecture
- Effective on small datasets

### 2. Attention U-Net
Attention U-Net extends the original U-Net by incorporating Attention Gates, allowing the network to focus on important wildfire regions while suppressing irrelevant background information.

**Advantages**
- Better feature localization
- Improved segmentation accuracy
- Reduces false positives

### 3. DeepLabV3+
DeepLabV3+ combines Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) with an encoder-decoder architecture to capture multi-scale contextual information while preserving object boundaries.

**Advantages**
- Excellent multi-scale feature extraction
- Better boundary segmentation
- Higher segmentation accuracy
- Selected as the best-performing model in this study

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Deep-Learning-Wildfire-Monitoring.git
```
### Install the required packages
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Download the Dataset
Download the FLAME dataset from:
https://ieee-dataport.org/open-access/flame-dataset-aerial-imagery-pile-burn-detection-using-drones-uavs

## 📊 Experimental Results
The three deep learning models were trained and evaluated using the FLAME wildfire dataset. Model performance was assessed using standard semantic segmentation metrics, including Dice Score and Intersection over Union (IoU).

The generated wildfire masks were further analyzed to estimate fire-affected regions and classify wildfire severity into different risk levels.

## 🏆 Model Comparison
| Model | Dice Score | IoU Score | Overall Performance |
|-------|-----------:|----------:|--------------------|
| U-Net | 0.6500 | 0.4830 | Good Baseline |
| Attention U-Net | 0.6287 | 0.4603 | Good |
| **DeepLabV3+** | **0.7332** | **0.5810** | ⭐ Best |

### Key Findings
- DeepLabV3+ achieved the highest Dice Score (**0.7332**) and IoU Score (**0.5810**), demonstrating superior wildfire segmentation performance.
- U-Net provided competitive results and served as a strong baseline model.
- Attention U-Net produced comparable segmentation results but slightly underperformed compared to U-Net and DeepLabV3+ on the FLAME dataset.
- DeepLabV3+ effectively captured multi-scale contextual information and generated more accurate wildfire boundaries, making it the most suitable model for the proposed wildfire monitoring framework.

## 🔍 Fire Severity Assessment
The predicted wildfire segmentation masks were used to estimate the percentage of fire-affected pixels in each image.

Based on the estimated fire percentage, wildfire severity was categorized into three risk levels:
| Fire Percentage | Risk Level |
|----------------:|-----------|
| < 1% | Low Risk |
| 1% – 5% | Moderate Risk |
| > 5% | High Risk |

This analysis demonstrates how semantic segmentation outputs can be transformed into meaningful information for wildfire monitoring and decision support.

## 🎯 Conclusion
This project successfully developed a deep learning-based wildfire monitoring framework using semantic segmentation techniques.

Three state-of-the-art segmentation models—U-Net, Attention U-Net, and DeepLabV3+—were implemented and evaluated on the FLAME dataset. Based on Dice Score, IoU Score, qualitative prediction results, and wildfire severity analysis, DeepLabV3+ achieved the best overall performance.

The proposed framework not only performs wildfire segmentation but also estimates fire-affected regions and classifies wildfire severity, making it suitable for future wildfire monitoring and disaster management applications.
